Just as a campfire needs kindling to burn, so too does learning require fuel.
That's why I'm creating a "Kindling" section â€“ a place where I share what's
fueling _my_ fire, and hopefully sparking some inspiration for you.

You'll find articles I've read, books I've finished, and my personal reflections
on them. By outlining my understanding and asking questions about what I've
read, I hope to solidify my knowledge and uncover any gaps. It's a way to learn
in public, and hopefully help others along the way.

So, if you're looking for inspiration and new resources to fuel your own
learning journey, look no further than the kindling.
