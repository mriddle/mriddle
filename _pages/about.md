# Matthew Riddle

Staff Software Engineer at Be My Eyes, working to improve the lives of the blind and 
visually impaired through technology.

With 16 years of experience across startups and global companies, he's moved between
management and IC roles, always focusing on high-impact modernization, solving
tough technical challenges, and supporting teams. Whether it's revamping legacy
systems, untangling technical messes, or mentoring others, the goal is always
the same—making things better for people and for systems.

A passion for learning, sharing knowledge, and bringing clarity to complexity
shapes his approach, often through writing.

Outside of work, he recharges by spending time with family, reading, or riding
his bike.

Originally from Australia, now living and working in Denmark.
