We're looking to hire enthusiastic, energetic and clever people. Are you great at Linux? AWS? Postgres? Ruby? MS SQL? A little of each, or a specialist in one field?

Send us a quick YouTube or Vimeo video telling us about yourself and what you're good at. Tell us a bit about:

1. What technology are you excited and passionate about?

2. What do you think is going to take off in the industry in the next year or 2?

3. Something entertaining (this one is completely optional).

Feel free to include anything else you like!

We're in London, so you'll need to be too.

We do accept standard CV's, but a video gives us a quick glimpse in to important things like cultural fit and communication qualities.
