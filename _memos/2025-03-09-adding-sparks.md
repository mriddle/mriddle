As I reboot my site, I'm excited to introduce a new element: "sparks"! Think of
them as quick memos - little bursts of insight that I want to capture and share.

Sparks are those fleeting moments of understanding, unexpected solutions, or
time-saving tools that I stumble upon. They might be:

- A new CLI tool that's changed my workflow.
- A useful code snippet.
- A thought-provoking question.

The key is that they're short, focused, and immediately useful. They're not
comprehensive guides or deeply researched posts – those are for the
"logs" section of the campfire.

But there's another reason I'm sharing these sparks: the best way to learn is to
teach. By sharing what I've learned, I solidify my own understanding and uncover
any gaps in my knowledge. And if it helps someone else along the way, even
better!

Sparks may be fleeting, but they can ignite logs that fuel deeper
understanding – for you, and for me.
