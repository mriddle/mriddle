Hey Everyone,

Stumbled upon a neat tip today. You can search through your Terminal history using the __reverse-i-search__ feature by hitting [ctrl]+r which also works on Mac :D

By doing this you should see the following
---
(reverse-i-search)`':
---

Start typing and it will find previous commands, if there are multiple matches you can hit [ctrl] + r again to cycle through the results. Hit enter to use the command or the left arrow to select it if you wish to modify the command before running it.

Enjoy!
